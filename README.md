# Detained U.S. Child Migrants

The U.S. is a popular destination for many immigrants, and this is no exception for children. Whether they were forced out of their native countries by war, or if they wanted better opportunities, they are often detained by the **Office of Refugee Resettlement** and taken away from their families. 
Despite court regulations that aim to release child migrants to releated sponsors within 20 days, **60.18% end up staying for much longer.** The main purpose is to see what makes children more likely to face long detainment periods like these and how the U.S. can improve
their current policies to help bring these children more justice.

## Origin
This project was originally inspired for my application for the Data School by the Information Lab for their NYC 9th cohort back in early 2025, where I made a Tableau dashboard based on the data provided by the New York Times and presented it to a coach. 
After being disappointed in my interview performance and rejection, I have decided to turn it into something bigger by applying everything I've learned since then. Since my father is a first-generation American whose family is from Ecuador, I know about the importance of 
Latin American immigration first-hand.

## My Personal Experience
I am fortunate to have been born in the United States to U.S. citizens and do not need to fear detainment of any sort. My father's family entered the U.S. legally as permanent residents back in the 1960s. However, I cannot help but wonder what happens to families who are desperate to
leave their countries and make the difficult decision to enter the U.S. through other means (let alone with children), especially since I have a Latin American and Spanish background. I cannot imagine the trauma that child migrants must go through to be taken away from their
families in search for a better life.

## Future Work
I would like to potentially make more complex machine learning models, and potentially involve other datasets and contributors. I want to showcase the skills that are needed for a successful Data Analyst or Data Scientist, since those are my dream careers. I would like to dig
deeper into the meanings of immigration to different countries and why different people may make this big change in their lives.

## Credits
The datasets in the [Borrowed](https://github.com/alyssarose05/Detained_U.S._Child_Migrants/tree/main/Borrowed) folder are not mine, but they were used for non-commercial purposes to make this project possible up to this point. **The final deliverables are my own work.**
