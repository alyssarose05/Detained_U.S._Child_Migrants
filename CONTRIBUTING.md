# Contributing

As an open-source data analysis project, I will gladly review all requests to contribute to this project in any way so that it may improve and have diverse points of view, so long as you **follow these rules:**

1. Abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/alyssarose05/child_migrants/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times. **Any and all violations will be dealt with accordingly.**
2. After you clone this repository and make your changes, create a new branch and submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
   -  In addition to a descriptive commit message, please write a description that explains why you made such changes and how they improve this project.
   -  I will make an effort to respond within 3-5 business days, but depending on the condition of the pull request, acceptance may _not_ be guaranteed, or I may request some more changes from you.
