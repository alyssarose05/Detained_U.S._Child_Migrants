# Contributing

As an open-source data analysis project, I will gladly review all requests to contribute to this project in any way so that it may improve and have diverse points of view, so long as you **follow these rules:**

1. Abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/alyssarose05/child_migrants/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times. **All violations will be taken very seriously.**
   - In this case, punishments may include being blocked on GitHub to prevent future contributions, and loss of access for anywhere else contributors may communicate.
2. After you clone this repository and make your changes, create a new branch and submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
   -  Please write a detailed commit message on the changes you made and why.
   -  I will make an effort to respond within 3-5 business days, but depending on the condition of the pull request, acceptance may _not_ be guaranteed, or I may request some more changes from you.
